I create a lot of code (mostly in R, but some Python too) to conduct my analyses. Most of that code sits on my computer, some of it makes its way to GitHub. I want more of a social outlet to work through issues I'm having and to share my successes. This blog should serve that purpose. Thanks for stopping by!
